\section{\label{sec:level1}Introduction}
%An ubiquitous feature of cortical neurons in vivo is that they show temporally irregular activity.
%The isi histograms of in vivo spike trains have exponential distribution.
%The spike count mean and variance are approximately equal to each other.
%These observations show that that in vivo spike trains have Poission-like statistics. 
\begin{itemize}
   \item Existence of feature seletivity in a random networks without a map, eg. rodent V1  
   \item Statistical properties of cortical recordings, balanced regime, modifying the $\mathcal{O}(1)$ inputs
   \item  Specific connections in balanced networks - rodent V1 during critical period
\end{itemize}
